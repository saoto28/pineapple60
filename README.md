ergonomic keyboard with Trackpoint

The purposes for this project.
- Install inside ThinkPad T470s (compatible with T460s)
- Install inside the Trackpoint keyboard (KU-1255 and KT-1255)

(Because they are alomost same size.)

## Next plan
- Connect the USB line inside the Thinkpad
- ~~Connect the Trackpoint module of the Trackpoint keyboard~~
- ~~Enable the center button scroll for Trackpoint keyboard~~
- Combine the USB connection between this new board and the original Trackpoint keyboard board.
