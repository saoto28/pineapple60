2021-08 V-style layout for ThinkPad T470s

Features:
- I decided on the V-style layout after testing various layouts with my variable layout keyboard.
- The MCU(Atmega 32u4) is directly installed on the PCB for making it thin. 
- Connect the USB line inside the Thinkpad.

- Give up the top row of key switches because of hitting the frame of the lid. 
- The key switches are the Kailh X-switches that I don't recommend. But, they are the only choice for the laptop.
- Though the key switches are still touching the LCD... I'm using this laptop for mobile.
